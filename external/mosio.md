## Motivation & Overview {#sec-external-mosio-motivation}

In recent years, many researchers have found that texting is a productive channel for keeping in touch with participants,
either by itself or as a supplement to conventional communication.
[Mosio](https://www.mosio.com/) is a company that develops, supports, and licenses a product called
[REDCap Direct](https://www.mosio.com/redcap/).

that we won't try to replicate in this manual.
Instead we'll outline when you might consider it,
and how to ask OU's [Server Administrators](../adminpr/user.md#sec-adminpr-user-role-ocri) for help establishing for your project.

## Limitations {#sec-external-mosio-limitation}

> What are the limitations of using Mosio?

Using Mosio for text messaging in clinical trials and other applications has several limitations:

1. Message Length:
  Text messages are limited to 160 characters,
  which can restrict the amount of information that can be conveyed in a single message.

1. User Engagement:
  Not all participants may be comfortable or familiar with text messaging,
  potentially leading to lower engagement rates.

1. Data Privacy:
  Ensuring the privacy and security of sensitive information transmitted via text messages can be challenging.
  While the transmission utilizing Mosio with REDCap is secure,
  you cannot ensure the security of the message when it reaches the recipient's phone.

1. Cost:
  Depending on the volume of messages sent, the cost of using Mosio can add up,
  especially for large-scale studies.

Despite these limitations,
Mosio remains a valuable tool for improving participant engagement and data collection in various settings.
If you have any specific concerns or need help with a particular aspect, feel free to ask!
