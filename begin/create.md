# Creating Records {#sec-begin-create}

<!--comment-->
<!--two # = 2nd level heading-->

**Chapter Leads**: Lise DeShea & Thomas Wilson

Creating records is analogous to taking out a copy of a form and starting to fill it out. 
In REDCap, forms (also called instruments) are nested within projects. You might create a 
record while testing a project during the development phase or after the project has been
put into production and data collection has begun for a study or investigation.

This chapter will show screenshots from a REDCap project that was created for the purpose of
letting data entry people practice. It is a copy of a real REDCap project involving a multi-site 
randomized controlled trial. These images do not show any protected health information (PHI); 
all information you may see is
pretend data made up by the people learning how to use the practice REDCap project before starting
real data collection with the study's actual REDCap for entering patient data.

After you have opened a REDCap project, you will see several links on the left side of the 
screen. One of them is labeled *Add/Edit Records*:

Clicking the Add/Edit Records link typically opens a screen where the new record is created.
This screen also assigns a unique identifying number to each record. Look for a green button 
labeled *Add new record*:

<!--put add-new-records.jpg here-->

After clicking that button, we see the *Record Home Page* for the new record:
