    "title": "4  Creating Records",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Chapter Leads: Lise DeShea & Thomas Wilson\nCreating records is analogous to taking out a copy of a form and starting to fill it out. In REDCap, forms (also called instruments) are nested within projects. You might create a record while testing a project during the development phase or after the project has been put into production and data collection has begun for a study or investigation.\nThis chapter will show screenshots from a REDCap project that was created for the purpose of letting data entry people practice. It is a copy of a real REDCap project involving a multi-site randomized controlled trial. These images do not show any protected health information (PHI); all information you may see is pretend data made up by the people learning how to use the practice REDCap project before starting real data collection with the study’s actual REDCap for entering patient data.\nAfter you have opened a REDCap project, you will see several links on the left side of the screen. One of them is labeled Add/Edit Records:\n\nClicking the Add/Edit Records link typically opens a screen where the new record is created. This screen also assigns a unique identifying number to each record. Look for a green button labeled Add new record:\n\nAfter clicking that button, we see the Record Home Page for the new record:\n\nThis page summarizes the status of the forms for Record ID 51. We see a list of 7 instruments. The gray circles to the right of each instrument is a link to that instrument. Notice the Legend for status icons box. It shows different colors of circles. A gray circle means the form has no data saved in it.\nThe Record Home Page is like a folder in which a clinic would keep all the forms for a given patient – except everything is blank, and all we have is a patient number (Record ID 51). We have created a record, but we need to go into each instrument to enter data. When we click on the gray dot next to the first instrument under Data Collection Instrument, we are taken to the Enrollment form for this project.\n\nAfter filling out the form for the 51st mother in this study, we come to the Form Status section:\n\nThis field has a drop-down menu. By clicking on the downward-pointing arrowhead next to the Incomplete, we see the menu of options:\n\nIf all the information has been included in this form, you will select Complete. The Incomplete option is good for situations where the form has fields for information that has to be entered later, and Unverified can be used for special situations in a study, such as an investigator needing to check a data entry person’s interpretation of an X-ray. Whatever status you choose will determine which color of button will be shown on the Record Status Dashboard. For this example, we will select Complete and click the blue button for Save & Exit Form. REDCap next will return you to the Record Home Page.\n\nNow the button next to Enrollment is green, which the Legend for status icons tells us is Complete. We can repeat this process for each of the other forms. In fact, we can go from saving one form directly into the next form. By clicking the green button next to Enrollment, we go back into Record ID 51’s Enrollment form. At the bottom of the page, the blue button labeled Save & Go To Next Form has a drop-down menu with three options:\n\nSave & Stay stores the entered data but leaves the form open on your screen. Save & Exit Record does the same thing as the blue Save & Exit button: it returns us to the Record Home Page. Save & Go To Next Record would take us to Record 52, if it existed in this project. Clicking on the blue Save & Go To Next Form button keeps us in Record 51 and opens the next instrument in the project.\nSometimes forms are set up as repeating instruments. In this practice project, the study allowed twins to be enrolled. The initial Enrollment form pertained to the mother, but the DR (Delivery Room) Information form is a repeating instrument, which the data entry person completes once for each twin. After all, the twins will have different birth weights and may receive different kinds of respiratory support.\nLet’s look at a list of the records already created for this project. We will click the Record Status Dashboard link on the left side of the page, shown in the first screenshot in this chapter. This dashboard shows different forms with different statuses, and to the right of some of the circles, there is a plus sign in a little gray box. We have drawn a yellow line next to three of these plus signs.\n\nThe plus sign is a link to create another instance (copy) of that form. We might want to do that if the form has been filled out for one twin and we were ready to complete the instrument for the other twin.\nThe Record Status Dashboard also has a green button labeled Add new record. That is another avenue for creating a record.\n\nNew records also are created when someone completes a REDCap survey. Those records would appear under the Record Status Dashboard. Our example project does not involve surveys.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAdditional Chapter Details\n\n\n\nThis chapter was last edited in October 2025.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Chapter Leads: Lise DeShea and Thomas Wilson\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAdditional Chapter Details\n\n\n\nImagine you are in a building with several floors. You want to know about all the offices in the building. Where might you look? One place you could look is near the elevator, where you often will find a directory listing everyone with offices in the building.\nThat directory is similar to the Record Status Dashboard within a REDCap project. When you want to find all the records in a project, you can navigate to the Record Status Dashboard by going into the project and following the link on the left side of your screen.\n\nWhen you click the link, you see a summary of all the records in the project. What is a record? It’s where all the information is kept about a specific person or entity on which data are collected. For our example project illustrated here, there are only three records and three forms:\n\nLet’s look at a dashboard with many more records. Will all of them show up on one page? It depends. Take a look at the screenshot below. (FYI, no private health information, PHI, will appear in these screenshots.)\n\nIt appears there are 103 records in the project, and this screen is showing the first of three pages of records. The drop-down menu at the right shows the page was set to display 50 records at a time. But the “Displaying record” field shows the records are numbered 1 through 54. That is because the creator of this project deleted a few records. The drop-down menu on the right can be set to show all records in the project.\nWhat else can we learn from this page? Well, the first column of the table is labeled Project. The purpose of this REDCap project is to track the status of all research projects that involve a specific statistician at OUHC; she created the REDCap to make notes on the status of all active projects. The column label, Project, is the label on the record number. As you recall, a record is where we save all the information about a specific person or entity. Here, the entity is the name of the project. So “Record ID” was changed to “Project” to be more descriptive for the user who is tracking many research projects.\nBy default, nothing is shown but the number, as we see in the second screenshot on this page. With this study tracking REDCap, the first column has the number assigned to each research project, as well as the name of the research project. Displaying the name of the research project is a customization of this REDCap project. On another project, you might want the customization to show the date that a patient enrolled in a study, or some other data point that was collected. Here is how to customize what is shown next to the record ID. On the left side of the screen, look for the link called Setup.\n\nThen look for the button that says Additional customations.\n\nClicking that button opens a window, with the first customization option being Set a Custom Record Label.\n\nIn the box labeled Custom Record Label, you can see that two variable names have been listed inside square brackets, [last_name_primary_contact] and [project_name], with a comma and a space between the variable names. Any words typed that are not variable names inside square brackets also can be typed there. After you have decided on your custom label for each record, click Save and go back to the Record Status Dashboard to see how the custom label looks.\nEach record on the Dashboard has a Record ID, usually a number automatically assigned by REDCap. Each number is a link to that record. The REDCap that tracks research studies has another link on the same row. Look for the column labeled Support Request. That is the only instrument in this project. As researchers request the statistician’s services, information is collected about that request. The green circles in the Support Request column are links to each project.\nClicking the record number takes you to the Record Home Page.\n\nThe legend in the top right of the following screenshot tells us the meaning of the Status circle’s color. A green circle, or button, means the record has been saved as complete. Clicking the green button takes us into the form for this research project. Let’s look at where the button’s color was determined. Look for the word Complete at the bottom of the form; that setting is responsible for the button’s color.\n\nLet’s take a look at a more complicated REDCap project with many instruments. The project we will examine was created for data entry people in a certain research study to practice entering data in a REDCap project identical to the one that was going to be used to collect actual data from patients. This practice project has made-up data.\n\nThe first column of this dashboard is labeled Record ID, the default name used by REDCap for assigning unique record numbers to each patient or entity for data collection. This column also has the word “Enrolled” followed by a date. This information was specified as an additional customization. This study had seven instruments: Enrollment, Randomize, Demographics, DR Information, Outcomes, Serious Adverse Event Form, and Protocol Deviations. Now we see many colors of buttons. The legend tells use red means Incomplete, yellow means Unverified, green means Complete, gray means no data was saved on that form for that patient, and overlapping buttons mean there is more than one copy of that form saved in the project. Blue overlapping buttons mean the multiple copies of the form have different statuses. If the overlapping buttons are red, yellow, or green, the multiple copies have the same status, as indicated by the color.\nWhen would you have multiple copies of the same form? Let’s use this REDCap project as an example. The study involved enrolling those who were about to have a baby. Those expecting twins could participate in the study. Once the twins were born, data were collected about each twin separately – birth weight, kind of respiratory support given immediately after birth, etc.\nSuppose you have entered the data on the first twin and you need to enter data about the second twin. You would find the row for that mother, go to a form you needed to complete about what happened to the second twin in the delivery room (the DR Information form), and look for the plus sign in the gray box.\n\nClicking that plus sign creates another copy of the same DR Information form and is a link to that copy. Data entry can proceed from there.\nThe Record Status Dashboard can be used to create custom dashboards as well. Look for the box toward the top of the page.\n\nClicking that box opens a form for creating the custom dashboard.\n\nSuppose we want to create a dashboard that shows data only for the mothers who signed up in Oklahoma for this multi-site study. We will need the record number, plus the instruments called Enrollment and Demographics. We can click on the little pencil icon next to Select instruments and specify those instruments.\n\nThen we can create filter logic that gives a statement that must be true in order to get only the records we want. In this example, we need the variable called site to equal Oklahoma. When we click in the Filter logic box, we get a Logic Editor window where the logical statement is written.\n\nThe name of the variable is in square brackets, then there is an equals sign, then the value that we want site to equal: Oklahoma. But notice: in this project, Oklahoma is the label for the site; it is not the data point that is saved in REDCap. In this project, the label Oklahoma was assigned to the number 1. The logic editor must give the data value, not the label Oklahoma. We click “Update & Close Editor,” then we click the blue button that says Save dashboard.\n\nWe get a message that the custom dashboard was saved, and we can click the gray button that says View dashboard.\n\nThen we will see the custom dashboard that we created.\n\nIf you ever look in your REDCap project and can’t see all your records, check the settings at the top of the Record Status Dashboard and see if you have navigated to a custom dashboard that shows only some of the records. You can switch dashboards by using the drop-down menu toward the top of the page and selecting Default dashboard.\n\nThis chapter was last edited in October 2025.

    "text": "14.1 Before sending your instruments or survey for testing, the designer (you) will need to:\nChapter Leads: Lise DeShea\nCongratulations on completing your REDCap project! When someone requests a REDCap project to be moved into production (i.e., to go live for data collection) the REDCap Administrator must ask: Has this project been adequately tested? Just as a company will test a new product and all of its parts before going into mass production, your REDCap project needs to be well-tested before going live.\nThoroughly testing your REDCap project before going live is important because you can lose data if you make changes to the survey/form after data collection has begun. If skip patterns are not correct, necessary questions can be skipped or data may be collected that is not required. If the question format is not correct, it may be difficult to analyze after data collection ends.\nWhy do we tell project developers to try to break their REDCap project?\nBreaking a project means testing your survey from a perspective of a naïve user who knows nothing about the project’s purpose or the data being collected. You need to think of all the ways the project could fail or be misunderstood, and try to make that happen. We created this checklist to guide your REDCap testing:",

    "text": "14.1.1 Check the field type for every variable\nMake sure the field type is what you had meant to select. For instance, is the date field using the correct validation, such as MM/DD/YYYY? Does a multiple-choice item allow only one response? If so, then it needs to be a radio button. A checkbox field allows multiple responses to be chosen on a multiple-choice item.\n\n\n14.1.2 Use clear language\n\nMany surveys/instruments are completed or used by people of different literacy levels or for whom English is a second language, so it is crucial to be as clear as possible.\nMake sure labels are clear and the logic between items is easy to follow. Vague labels and difficult-to-follow logic can lead to items being skipped and data to be missing, or incorrect responses may be entered. Example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.1: Ambiguous “Name.”\n\n\n\nWhose name? The person filling out the form? Their first name? Last name? The last name of a family in the home? What if they have different last names? The survey might be clear to the person creating the project, but a second or third set of eyes may catch items that are unclear.\n\n\n14.1.3 Inspect each field and think about what the data will look like for the person eventually analyzing the data\nExample:\nWith a fill-in-the-blank text field like the one above, here are some of the ways that someone may report a birthday:\nJanuary 8, 1999    08 January 1999    Jan 8, 99   1-8-1999\nJan. 8, 1999      jan 8 1999          1999-1-8    8 Jan ‘99\nA subsequent analysis would report there were 8 different dates entered, instead of 8 people with the same birth date. And forget about being able to calculate someone’s current age based on these data! Use REDCap’s built-in data validation capability whenever possible. Go through your items and figure out if you can validate each field in some way. Even something like “Child’s age” could be entered numerous ways in a free-text field:\nSeven    7 years old        Don't know      8 on his next birthday\n7        7 years, 4 months  I don't know\nYou might modify your item to specify “Child’s age (in years)” and use data validation to require the person to enter an integer.\n\n\n14.1.4 Check whether your project is failing to collect necessary data, either by fields not being completed or fields being left off the form\n\nGo back to the original plan for the project and check your work.\nWhat was the purpose of the project? Did every needed field get included in your instruments/survey?\nWill the fields in your instruments/survey collect the information required to to fulfill the needs that motivated the project?\n\n\n\n14.1.5 Test the survey yourself\n\nMany times, omissions or errors can be found by testing the survey/instrument yourself.\nEnter test data. If you are testing a survey, follow along with the paper survey and see if it matches with what is in REDCap.\nReview the data you just entered and see if the data is what you expected.",

    "text": "14.2 When you decide you are ready to have individuals enter test data on your instrument or survey, select the individual(s) that you want to test your project\n\n14.2.1 Have at least one other person enter test data in your instruments or survey.\n\nSometimes the person creating the project is too close to it and can’t see its limitations. A second, third or fourth set of eyes is crucial, and they can enter many test records with different scenarios in mind.\nCould any of the items be misunderstood by a naïve user?\nCheck the data entered to see if the questions meet the goals of the project? Example:\n\nIf people with diabetes need to answer extra questions, has the branching logic been set up correctly so that those items only appear when someone says they have diabetes? Your tester(s) should enter data for different kinds of study participants. This step is important to complete before a project is moved into production because you may not be able to test changes in branching logic at a later point.\n\nDoes the survey work equally well on a cell phone vs. a computer? Having multiple testers will allow testing on different platforms.\nIs there enough room in the text box for answers or do you need to change it to a notes box?\n\nTesting a public survey\n\nPublic surveys can be distributed from REDCap email or through an OU email with an embedded link. The tester’s email address is required.\nIf there is a paper survey, send selected individuals a copy and have them check to see if it matches what they see in REDCap. Other testers can test the survey without using the paper survey.\n\nTesting data collection forms that are not surveys\n\nTesting data collection forms in REDCap (i.e., it is not a public survey), will need to be done by individuals within your group or by individuals who will have temporary access to the project for testing only. They will need to be removed from the project prior to pushing the project to production and prior to collecting data collection.\n\n\n\n14.2.2 Have at least one other person who is familiar with the study or investigation check whether the REDCap project matches any printed documents, like IRB protocols and approved procedures.\n\nIs the project accurate and staying within the bounds of what has been intended or IRB-approved?\nIs the wording correct on all instruments?\nIs everything spelled correctly?\nIs the skip logic correct? Does the skip logic match what is in the printed survey?\nAre all the items present?\nHave any items been added that were not approved by the IRB (and therefore should be deleted)?\nAre calculated variables producing correct answers?\n\n\n\n14.2.3 Ask the individuals testing your instruments/survey if the forms/surveys are user-friendly in its appearance\n\nAre the colors easy on the eyes?\nAre colors acceptable for people who are color-blind?\nIf a team will be entering data directly into REDCap (i.e., it is not a public survey), are the instruments too long? Could the instrument be broken up into shorter instruments so the data entry person doesn’t feel like they’re working on the Great Wall of China?\nCould some items be put into a table using the rich text editor in a descriptive field? These tables can save space and require less scrolling by the data entry person. Ask your REDCap Administrator how to do that.",

    "text": "15.1 Before Testing\nChapter Leads: Lise DeShea\nCongratulations on completing your REDCap project! When someone requests a REDCap project to be moved into production (i.e., to go live for data collection) the REDCap Administrator must ask: Has this project been adequately tested? Just as a company will test a new product and all of its parts before going into mass production, your REDCap project needs to be well-tested before going live.\nThoroughly testing your REDCap project before going live is important because you can lose data if you make changes to the survey/form after data collection has begun. If skip patterns are not correct, necessary questions can be skipped or data may be collected that is not required. If the question format is not correct, it may be difficult to analyze after data collection ends.\nWhy do we tell project developers to try to break their REDCap project?\nBreaking a project means testing your survey from a perspective of a naïve user who knows nothing about the project’s purpose or the data being collected. You need to think of all the ways the project could fail or be misunderstood, and try to make that happen. We created this checklist to guide your REDCap testing:\nBefore sending your instruments or survey for testing, the designer (you) will need to:",

    "text": "15.1.1 Field Type\nCheck the field type for every variable\nMake sure the field type is what you had meant to select. For instance, is the date field using the correct validation, such as MM/DD/YYYY? Does a multiple-choice item allow only one response? If so, then it needs to be a radio button. A checkbox field allows multiple responses to be chosen on a multiple-choice item.\n\n\n15.1.2 Use clear language\n\nMany surveys/instruments are completed or used by people of different literacy levels or for whom English is a second language, so it is crucial to be as clear as possible.\nMake sure labels are clear and the logic between items is easy to follow. Vague labels and difficult-to-follow logic can lead to items being skipped and data to be missing, or incorrect responses may be entered. Example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.1: Ambiguous “Name”.\n\n\n\nWhose name? The person filling out the form? Their first name? Last name? The last name of a family in the home? What if they have different last names? The survey might be clear to the person creating the project, but a second or third set of eyes may catch items that are unclear.\n\n\n15.1.3 Anticipate Analysis\nInspect each field and think about what the data will look like for the person eventually analyzing the data\nExample:\nWith a fill-in-the-blank text field like the one above, here are some of the ways that someone may report a birthday:\nJanuary 8, 1999    08 January 1999    Jan 8, 99   1-8-1999\nJan. 8, 1999      jan 8 1999          1999-1-8    8 Jan ‘99\nA subsequent analysis would report there were 8 different dates entered, instead of 8 people with the same birth date. And forget about being able to calculate someone’s current age based on these data! Use data validation in REDCap whenever possible. Go through your items and figure out if you can validate each field in some way. Even something like “Child’s age” could be entered numerous ways in a free-text field:\nSeven    7 years old        Don't know      8 on his next birthday\n7        7 years, 4 months  I don't know\nYou might modify your item to specify “Child’s age (in years)” and use data validation to require the person to enter an integer.\n\n\n15.1.4 Necessary Data\nCheck whether your project is failing to collect necessary data, either by fields not being completed or fields being left off the form\n\nGo back to the original plan for the project and check your work.\nWhat was the purpose of the project? Did every needed field get included in your instruments/survey?\nWill the fields in your instruments/survey collect the information required to to fulfill the needs that motivated the project?\n\n\n\n15.1.5 Test the survey yourself\nTest the survey yourself\n\nMany times, omissions or errors can be found by testing the survey/instrument yourself.\nEnter test data. If you are testing a survey, follow along with the paper survey and see if it matches with what is in REDCap.\nReview the data you just entered and see if the data is what you expected.",

    "text": "15.2 Select Testers\nWhen you decide you are ready to have individuals enter test data on your instrument or survey, select the individual(s) that you want to test your project\n\n15.2.1 First Tester\nHave Ask at least one other person to enter test data in your instruments or survey\n\nSometimes the person creating the project is too close to it and can’t see its limitations. A second, third or fourth set of eyes is crucial, and they can enter many test records with different scenarios in mind.\nCould any of the items be misunderstood by a naïve user?\nCheck the data entered to see if the questions meet goals of the project? Example:\n\nIf people with diabetes need to answer extra questions, has the branching logic been set up correctly so that those items only appear when someone says they have diabetes? Your tester(s) should enter data for different kinds of study participants. This step is important to complete before a project is moved into production because you may not be able to test changes in branching logic at a later point.\n\nDoes the survey work equally well on a cell phone vs. a computer? Having multiple testers will allow you to have them test the project on different platforms.\nIs there enough room in the text box for answers or do you need to change it to a notes box?\n\nTesting a public survey\n\nPublic surveys can be distributed from REDCap email or through an OU email with an embedded link. The tester’s email address is required.\nIf there is a paper survey, send selected individuals a copy and have them check to see if it matches what they see in REDCap. Other testers can test the survey without using the paper survey.\n\nTesting data collection forms that are not surveys\n\nTesting data collection forms in REDCap (i.e., it is not a public survey), will need to be done by individuals within your group or by individuals that who have access in the project for testing only and will need to be removed from the project prior to pushing the project to production and prior to collecting data collection.\n\n\n\n15.2.2 Compared to Printed Versions\nHave at least one other person who is familiar with the study or investigation check whether the REDCap project matches any printed documents, like IRB protocols and approved procedures\n\nIs the project accurate and staying within the bounds of what has been intended or IRB-approved?\nIs the wording correct on all instruments?\nIs everything spelled correctly?\nIs the skip logic correct? Does the skip logic match what is in the printed survey?\nAre all the items present?\nHave any items been added that were not approved by the IRB (and therefore should be deleted)?\nAre calculated variables producing correct answers?\n\n\n\n15.2.3 User-Friendly Appearance\nAsk the individuals testing your instruments/survey if the forms/surveys are user-friendly in its appearance\n\nAre the colors easy on the eyes?\nAre colors acceptable for people who are color-blind?\nIf a team will be entering data directly into REDCap (i.e., it is not a public survey), are the instruments too long? Could the instrument be broken up into shorter instruments so the data entry person doesn’t feel like they’re working on the Great Wall of China?\nCould some items be put into a table using the rich text editor in a descriptive field? These tables can save space and require less scrolling by the data entry person. Ask your REDCap Administrator how to do that.",

It is the RT’s responsibility to periodically review this dashboard.\n\n\n16.2.2.3 Do you enforce the principle of least privilege (admins vs. data entry vs. monitors)?\nThe RT works with their team members and should be aware of their roles approved by the IRB.\nIt is the RT’s responsibility to assign the appropriate levels of privileges.\n\n\n\n16.2.3 Account Provisioning and Deprovisioning (Subsec B3)\n\n16.2.3.1 Is there a clear process to grant, modify, or revoke system access when personnel changes roles or leave the organization?\nYes, the REDCap user rights dashboard allows RT staff to easily grant, modify, or revoke system access when personnel changes occur.\nIt is the RT’s responsibility to monitor staff changes and make the appropriate system access modifications when necessary.\n\n\n16.2.3.2 Must accounts be removed within a certain time frame (e.g., 24 hours) after staff departure\nYes, REDCap allows for the expedient removal of staff from the appropriate REDCap projects.\nIt is the RT’s responsibility to monitor staff changes and remove accounts from the projects.\n\n\n16.2.3.3 Do new users undergo formal training or competency checks before access is granted?\nYes, the RA team provides general REDCap training on how to operate the system. The RT will be responsible for training and competency check for the specific project that new staff will be using.\n\n\n\n16.2.4 Audit Trail Review (Subsec C3)\n\n16.2.4.1 Is there a process for periodically reviewing audit trails and investigating any anomalies?\nYes, REDCap maintains an audit log for all transactions within a specific project. It is easily accessible and downloadable as a .csv file.\nIt is the responsibility of the RT to review the audit logs and investigate any anomalies.\n\n\n16.2.4.2 Is there a routine schedule (monthly, quarterly) for audit trail reviews?\nWith the accessibility of the REDCap audit log, scheduling of reviews can be done at any appropriate schedule.\nIt is the responsibility of the RT to schedule the audit trail reviews.\n\n\n16.2.4.3 Who is responsible for these reviews, and are they qualified to interpret logs?\nREDCap maintains the audit log in an accessible and downloadable format.\nThe RT is responsible for assigning the reviewer and determining their qualification to interpret the logs.\n\n\n16.2.4.4 Do you conduct forensic reviews if suspicious activity is detected?\nThe RT is responsible for conducting forensic reviews if suspicious activity is detected.\n\n\n\n16.2.5 Data Entry and Validation Checks (Subsec C4)\n\n16.2.5.1 Do you conduct forensic reviews if suspicious activity is detected?\nYes, REDCap allows data fields to be configured with multiple data validation rules. These rules include format checks, ranges for dates and numeric entries, required fields, and designating that a field is an identifier. REDCap also utilizes functionality called “Action Tags” to further ensure that data are collected in an accurate, efficient manner. The RA team can train the RT on all of these features, but it is the responsibility of the RT to implement the features into their projects.\n\n\n16.2.5.2 How do you handle data corrections or errors (formal data query, edit check process)?\nREDCap allows for users with appropriate permissions to correct data or errors within a project. Any changes to the data are recorded in the REDCap audit log. Additionally, REDCap has a field comment log for each field. The field comment log allows users to record the reason they are making a modification to the data for each field that needs to be corrected.\nIt is the responsibility of the RT to make data corrections or address errors.\n\n\n16.2.5.3 When data collection instruments are updated, is the previous version retained to show how data were collected at any point in time?\nYes, REDCap, when in production mode, creates a snapshot of all data collection instruments whenever a change is requested.\nIt is the responsibility of the RT to ensure that REDCap is in production mode prior to collecting research data.\n\n\n16.2.5.4 Does the system lock old forms when a new version is released, preventing retrospective changes?\nYes, when a new version of a form is released, the old form is retired from data entry.\n\n\n16.2.5.5 How do you inform users about updated forms (e.g., release notes, training)?\nWhen a REDCap project is in production and updates are requested, the individual on the RT requesting the changes will receive an email notification from the system when the changes have been approved.\nIt is the responsibility of the change requestor to inform the remainder of the RT of any changes that have been made.\n\n\n16.2.5.6 Do you use encryption of secure FTP for high-risk data transfers?\nREDCap stores data in secure vm’s on the OUHSC campus. It is the responsibility of the RT to ensure the security of that data when it has been extracted from REDCap.\n\n\n16.2.5.7 How do you ensure integrity if data are exported for analysis outside of REDCap?\nIt is the responsibility of the RT to ensure the security of data if it has been exported outside of REDCap for analysis.",
